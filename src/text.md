### React:
The smallest React example looks like this:
```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

In the above example, `<h1>Hello, world!<h1>;` is called a JSX element

**Why JSX?**
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: 
- How events are handled
- How the state changes over time
- How the data is prepared for display.

> "JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript."
